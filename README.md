# Talking Lab Counter

###A talking counter with a choice of voices and sounds.

######Description: 
Talking Lab Counter speaks your totals so you can focus on your lab counts. No need to look up to see if you've added to the correct column--the app says the total in a distinct voice or pitch to differentiate each counter.

######Features: 
- AVFoundation framework and the AVSpeechSynthesizer class allows for different voices/languages and sounds to provide feedback to the user.
- Delegation pattern to pass information from the settings controllers to the main view controller.
- NSUserDefaults stores voice settings.
- CoreData stores lab reports.
- Adaptive Layout allows the app to work on all iPhone sizes and the iPad.
