# Talking Lab Counter

A talking counter with a choice of voices and sounds.

I used the AVFoundation framework and the AVSpeechSynthesizer class to create a counter that uses different voices/languages and sounds to provide feedback to the user on which column is incremented or decremented.

The app also provides an example of a delegation pattern to pass information from the settings controllers to the main view controller.

The app stores settings in NSUserDefaults and saves count information using Core Data.

The use of Adaptive Layout allows the app to work on all iPhone sizes and the iPad.
