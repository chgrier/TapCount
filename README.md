Voice Counter
========

A talking counter with a choice of voices and sounds.

Uses AVSpeechSynthesizer and AVFoundation frameworks to create a counter that uses different voices and sounds to provide feedback on which counter is incremented or decremented. 

The app also provides an example of a delegation pattern to pass information from the settings controllers to the main view controller.
